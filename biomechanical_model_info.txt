# Body kinematics
3D cartesian positions of body frames expressed in the world frame.
Each header is structured as: bodyName_Side_coordinate
_tx - x-position
_ty - y-position
_tz - z_position
_r - right side
_l - left side

# Generalized coordinates
Most headers exactly correspond to the kinematic degree of freedom 
that can be found in the model description (https://modelhealth.notion.site/Musculoskeletal-model-22b67c127383804d918fddf2baec47fd).
Some mappings here to avoid any confusion:
knee_angle - knee flexion/extension
mtp_angle - metatarsophalangeal joint (toe joint), can be ignored
sh_tx, sh_ty, sh_tz - translational degree of freedom in the scapulothoracic joint (shoulder joint)
sh_plane_elev - shoulder plane elevation
sh_elev - shoulder elevation
sh_axial_rot - shoulder axial rotation
pro_sup - forearm pronation-supination
